# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Stock market prices are difficult to predict using traditional models due to their sequential and volatile nature. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is well-suited for time-series prediction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

## 📁 Files

- `Stock Price Prediction.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all code and plots.
- `README.md`: This file.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shiva1916/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 Open the notebook: Run Stock Price Prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Results:The LSTM model learns from past stock data and predicts future prices. 
You’ll see a line plot comparing actual vs predicted prices.
